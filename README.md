# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard 
This is a webpage that takes city inputs and, using multiple API's, returns 6 weather forecasted days, with the first day shown larger than the others and located at the top of the webpage. Previous searches are stored and arranged as buttons that make navigation easy. This was my first project utilizing API's, and I found that to be exciting because of how useful a skill that will be for future projects.
